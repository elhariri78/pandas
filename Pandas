# Pandas Library in Python

**Pandas** is an open-source library in Python used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful and easy-to-use data structures, such as DataFrames and Series, for handling structured data. It is one of the most popular libraries for data analysis in Python.

## Key Components of Pandas

### 1. **DataFrame**
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). It is similar to a table or spreadsheet.

### 2. **Series**
A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type. It is similar to a column in a DataFrame.
